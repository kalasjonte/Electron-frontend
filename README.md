Right now this project isnt finished, but it can start ps2 games so the primary functionality is done. This upload is only to be able to show it on my resume. You will need: Ps2 games, and the pcsx2 emulator to run this (unstable) build. Have been a joy to work with and will continute to work on it on my spare time.
